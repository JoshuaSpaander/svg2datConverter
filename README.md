# svg2datConverter

Thank you for visiting my github repository!

These are the files of code which can convert svg files to dat files (including selig formatting if you so chose!).

The folders are split into different versions of the software. You can run the python files by clicking on them and following the instructions in the command line/terminal or where ever you chose to open them. Then you follow the instructions. Note, that the files in the folder must be present in the same folder directory.

Newer and improved versions will be uploaded here when they are finished. If you have suggestions or comments, feel free to leave them somewhere.
